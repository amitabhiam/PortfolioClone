**Bug Fixes**

* Corrected failure to translate currencies by preventing two `Rate` objects, which represent same currency pair, from existing in the `PositionContainer` (e.g. ^EURUSD and ^USDEUR).
* Eliminated multiple unnecessary calls to the `PositionGroup.setForexRates` function.
* Eliminated multiple unnecessary calls to the `PositionContainer.refresh` function.
