**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed issue that caused the number of effective shares for a dividend (or a distribution) to be calculated incorrectly when the dividend (or distribution) is paid in an alternate currency.
* Added rounding to the number of effective shares which should help to reduce confusion. However, this is value is derived, and the rounded value may be incorrect.
